# Call Your Congresspeople

![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/StayWokeOrg/general-congress-hotline.svg?branch=master)

This app uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to connect people with their senators and representatives.

You can read more about it here: http://www.ianww.com/blog/2016/06/15/call-your-congressperson-with-one-phone-number-1-844-usa-4522/

## Getting started running locally:

- Clone this repository and type `npm install`.
- Set up your `.env` file.  For a dummy `.env`, run `cp example_dot_env .env`
- Run `node cyc_entry.js` to start the server.

## Run with a specific configuration

By default, the app uses the configuration specified in `config/default.js`.

You can set this configuration in your `.env` file:

```
CONFIG=./config/my_config.js
```

Or you can override this on the command line:

```
CONFIG=./config/my_config.js node cyc_entry.js
```

## How It Works

Call Congress uses the caller's ZIP code in conjunction with the [Sunlight Congress API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) to connect the caller directly to their federal representatives.

- Caller calls in to the central number handling all redirects
- Caller is instructed as to what will happen after having called this number
- Caller is prompted for their Zip Code, followed by the pound (#) sign. They're given 10 seconds to complete, or are disconnected
- Caller is informed that they'll be connected to their senators and representatives one-after-another. If they want to skip a call, they can press star (*).
- Once the caller has gone through all their senators and representatives, they are informed that their session is ended.
- App disconnects.

### If a caller enters a bad Zip Code

- Caller is informed that no representatives were able to be found for their zip code, and they should try calling again.
- App disconnects.

## Development

There are several commands that make development easier

- `npm run start:watch` runs the server and restarts on file changes
- `npm run test:watch` runs tests on every file change
- `npm run tunnel` sets up a tunnel using [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) and prints the web address that Twilio can use to the console

## Contributing
